# NN_Grid_search
Here I have implemented a convenient OOP interface for grid search over parameters of neural net.

On an example of diabetes dataset form sklearn I have solved a regression problem using PyTorch. 
This has turned out to be very flexible model, that needs very few tuning for implementing it to any ather dataset.
